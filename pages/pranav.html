          <h1>Settle in, hit pause on reality, and let my story take the lead..</h1>
          <p>Let me tell you a storyâ€”my story. A few years ago, something happened that changed everything for me, shaping who I am today. Why am I sharing this? Because those moments, however difficult, brought out the best version of me. And I think itâ€™s time for the world to hear it.
            This story begins in Ludhiana, a bustling city in Punjab, India, where I spent the first 18 years of my life in the same home. Then, life took a major turn. I moved halfway across the world to Canada, alone, with no clear idea of what the future held for me. This is the story of a boy who dreamed big but was paralyzed by fearâ€”too scared to step up, too scared to be seen. He was afraid of his parents, of making friends (which, by the way, he never had), and even of facing the world around him.
            Now, letâ€™s talk about the key players: my parents, my younger brother, my grandparents, and my uncle and aunt. But, of course, the hero of this story? Thatâ€™s me (I mean, whatâ€™s a story without a hero, right?). Whether I managed to overcome these fears or notâ€”well, thatâ€™s something youâ€™ll have to decide by the end.
            Expect a bit of everythingâ€”fun, drama, maybe even some action. If this were a movie, Iâ€™d make sure it had a little something for everyone. So, buckle up and letâ€™s see how this unfolds.
            <br><br>
            LETâ€™S START!
            <br><br>
            <b>THE BOY - Who Didnâ€™t Belong!</b>
            <br>
            Since childhood, money was all this boy ever heard aboutâ€”how much there was or, more accurately, how much there wasnâ€™t. His father worked tirelessly to provide for everyone: his wife, two sons, parents, and extended family.
            Despite the financial struggles, his parents ensured he attended a top-rated private schoolâ€”one known for its prestige and high fees. Most students came from wealthy families. But how did he and his younger brother end up there? Their father was a teacher at the school, which made tuition possible.
            But being part of an elite institution didnâ€™t mean he was accepted.
            Every day, he was bullied, humiliated, and excluded. His classmates whispered about weekend parties they all attendedâ€”except for him. Theyâ€™d laugh and joke right in front of him, making it painfully clear he was an outsider.
            <br><br>
            Why did they treat him this way?<br>
            The answer: his father.
            <br><br>
            His father was one of the schoolâ€™s strictest teachersâ€”a man who struck fear into students with his reputation alone. The students hated attending his classes, and unfortunately, that hatred extended to his son. He became guilty by association.
            Adding to his struggles, the boy was thin, not conventionally good-looking, and struggled academically. His classmates mocked his familyâ€™s financial situation, making him feel small and powerless. Worst of all, he never spoke up about itâ€”not to his parents, not to anyone.
            <br><br>
            <b>His Escape? Soccer.</b>
            <br><br>
            For years, he carried the weight of being an outsider, a failure, a nobody. But there was one place where none of that matteredâ€”the soccer field.
            Whenever he had a spare moment, he would run to the field and play. He had no formal training, no coachâ€”just pure love for the game.
            By seventh grade, he made it onto the schoolâ€™s soccer team. But during a crucial match, he made a mistake that cost them the league. His teammates never let him forget it.
            Instead of giving up, his father enrolled him in a soccer academy, where he trained two hours every day. Slowly, he improved. He became one of the best defenders in the school.
            One day, during a match, he was finally subbed onto the field. The opponents tried to break through, but not a single one got past him. His teammatesâ€”who once doubted himâ€”watched in awe.
            That day, they gave him a nickname: "The Wall."
            Six players from the winning team were selected for the district-level team. He was one of them. It was one of the greatest moments of his life.
            But soccer was only one battle. There were still many more fights ahead.
            <br><br>
            <b>The Burden of Silence</b>
            <br><br>
            His academic struggles never stopped haunting him. His parents pushed him into long hours of tuition classesâ€”sometimes up to six hours a day.
            Each day was the same: school, eat, tuition, repeat. No time for himself. No freedom.
            But there was one battle he never spoke about.
            One of his tuition teachers had a son, a boy who started harassing him. What started as subtle suggestions escalated into demands he didnâ€™t know how to handle.
            He wanted to speak up. He wanted to tell someone.
            But the shame was unbearable.
<br>
            So he stayed silent.
<br>
            Every moment was suffocating. He wished someone would noticeâ€”but no one ever did.
            <br><br>

            <b>A Home Divided</b>
            <br><br>
            His home was far from peaceful.
<br>
            Conversations revolved around money, debts, and unpaid bills. His grandparents mistreated his father, favoring his uncle instead. His mother was treated like a maid, working endlessly without appreciation.
            At night, he would sit in a corner, hugging a pillow, watching his mother collapse from exhaustion. His father sometimes had to feed her, holding her in his arms just to keep her from breaking down.
            These moments numbed him.<br>
            He realized something:<br>
            His family wasnâ€™t as big as he once thought.
            It was just the four of themâ€”him, his brother, and their parents. No one else truly cared.
            <br>From that day on, he made a promise to himself:<br>
            "One day, I will become so successful that my parents will never have to worry about money again."<br>
            He wanted to give them a life where theyâ€™d never have to ask for permission to dream.
<br><br>
            <b>A Spark in the Dark</b>
            <br><br>
            In 11th grade, amidst the COVID lockdown, he met someone unexpectedlyâ€”a girl from his tuition class.
            She was quiet, reserved, focused. They met through a WhatsApp group debate over a physics question.
            Their conversations lasted hours. They lived just two intersections apart, yet they had never met in personâ€”until one day, they did.
            She arrived on a bike, leaping off to greet him. He thought sheâ€™d hug himâ€”but instead, she shook his hand. They were both too shy.
            He still remembers how she looked that dayâ€”wearing a pink and white dress, her quiet nature hiding something deeper.
            He had no idea she would become one of the most important people in his life.
<br><br>
            <b>The End? Not Quite.</b>
            <br><br>
            This isnâ€™t just a story of a boy who struggled.<br>
            Itâ€™s a story of a boy who fought.<br>
            He fought to belong.<br>
            He fought to prove himself.<br>
            He fought to break free.<br>
            Did he win?<br>
            Maybe. Maybe not.<br>
            But his story isnâ€™t over yet.<br>
            This was just the first chapter.<br>
            The real journey? Thatâ€™s still unfolding.<br>
            So sit back, stay tunedâ€”because the best part is yet to come. ðŸŽ¬âœ¨<br>
